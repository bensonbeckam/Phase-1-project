# 🌤️ Weather App

A sleek and simple weather application that lets users search for any city and view real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description. The app also includes a multi-day forecast section for upcoming weather conditions.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔎 Search any city to view current weather
- 🌡️ Displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- 📝 Weather description (e.g. Clear sky, Rain, etc.)
- 📅 Forecast for the next few days
- 📦 Clean folder structure with organized assets, styles, and scripts
- 📡 Uses a live Weather API to fetch data dynamically

## 🗂️ Project Structure
.
├── assets/ # Contains all PNG images and icons

## 🔧 How It Works

1. User enters a city name in the search input.
2. JavaScript fetches current weather and forecast data using a public Weather API.
3. Data is displayed dynamically in the browser.
4. Icons and styles enhance user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Search any city to view its weather!

> ⚠️ You’ll need an API key for the weather API you're using — make sure to include it in your `script.js`.
